**Late Appeal Options:**
1. **Good Cause Exception** - Contact your insurer immediately explaining why you missed the deadline
2. **State Insurance Commissioner** - File a complaint if you weren't properly notified
3. **External Review** - Some states allow late external appeals for good cause
4. **Legal Aid** - Contact local legal aid for assistance with late appeals

**Valid Reasons for Late Appeals:**
‚Ä¢ Never received the denial letter
‚Ä¢ Serious illness preventing timely response
‚Ä¢ Death in family or emergency
‚Ä¢ Postal service delays
‚Ä¢ Insurer provided wrong deadline information

**Action Steps:**
1. Call your insurance immediately to request a late appeal
2. Document why you missed the deadline
3. File with your state insurance commissioner simultaneously
4. Gather all medical documentation quickly

‚è∞ Time is critical - act within the next few days if possible. Many late appeals are accepted with valid explanations!`;

  if (msg.includes('prior authorization') || msg.includes('prior auth')) {
    return `Prior authorization is insurance's way of pre-approving expensive treatments - here's what you need to know:

**What is Prior Authorization?**
‚Ä¢ Insurance approval required BEFORE receiving certain treatments
‚Ä¢ Designed to control costs and ensure medical necessity
‚Ä¢ Required for expensive procedures, medications, specialist visits

**Why You Didn't Know:**
‚Ä¢ Many doctors' offices handle this automatically
‚Ä¢ Sometimes insurance changes requirements without notice
‚Ä¢ Emergency situations may bypass prior auth requirements

**How to Handle This:**
1. **Ask your doctor's office** - They usually handle prior auth requests
2. **Call insurance** - Get the specific requirements and forms needed
3. **Submit medical justification** - Doctor must explain why treatment is necessary
4. **Follow up regularly** - Prior auth can take 3-15 business days

**If Denied:**
‚Ä¢ Appeal immediately with stronger medical justification
‚Ä¢ Get peer-to-peer review (doctor talks to insurance doctor)
‚Ä¢ Request expedited review for urgent situations

**Emergency Exception:**
If you need immediate treatment, get it and appeal later - emergency care often overrides prior auth requirements.`;
  }

  if (msg.includes('experimental') || msg.includes('investigational')) {
    return `"Experimental" or "investigational" denials are common but often challengeable:

**What This Means:**
‚Ä¢ Insurance claims the treatment isn't proven effective
‚Ä¢ Often used to deny newer, expensive treatments
‚Ä¢ Sometimes used incorrectly for established treatments

**How to Fight This:**
1. **Get peer-reviewed studies** - Ask your doctor for research supporting the treatment
2. **Check FDA approval** - If FDA-approved, it's not truly experimental
3. **Find coverage policies** - Some insurers cover "experimental" treatments in certain cases
4. **Appeal with evidence** - Submit medical literature supporting effectiveness

**Strong Appeal Arguments:**
‚Ä¢ Treatment is FDA-approved for your condition
‚Ä¢ Major medical organizations recommend it
‚Ä¢ Peer-reviewed studies show effectiveness
‚Ä¢ Standard treatments have failed for you
‚Ä¢ Treatment is widely accepted in medical community

**Special Cases:**
‚Ä¢ **Clinical trials** - May be covered if standard treatments failed
‚Ä¢ **Off-label use** - FDA-approved drugs used for different conditions
‚Ä¢ **Rare diseases** - Often get special consideration

**Next Steps:**
1. Request your insurance's medical coverage policy for this treatment
2. Get detailed letter from doctor explaining medical necessity
3. Gather supporting research and FDA information
4. Consider external review if internal appeal fails

Your child deserves access to effective treatments - don't give up after the first denial!`;

    return `Out-of-network emergency billing is a common but often illegal practice:

**Your Rights in Emergencies:**
‚Ä¢ Emergency services MUST be covered at in-network rates
‚Ä¢ You cannot be "balance billed" for emergency care
‚Ä¢ This applies even if the hospital is out-of-network
‚Ä¢ Protections under the No Surprises Act (federal law)

**What to Do:**
1. **Don't pay the bill yet** - You likely don't owe these charges
2. **Contact your insurance** - Demand they cover at in-network rates
3. **File a complaint** - With your state insurance commissioner
4. **Document everything** - Keep all records of the emergency

**Common Situations:**
‚Ä¢ Emergency room physician is out-of-network (not allowed to balance bill)
‚Ä¢ Ambulance took you to out-of-network hospital
‚Ä¢ Emergency procedure by out-of-network specialist
‚Ä¢ Anesthesiologist during emergency surgery

**How to Fight This:**
1. Call the billing department and explain it was an emergency
2. Request all charges be adjusted to in-network rates
3. File appeals with both insurance and the hospital
4. Reference the No Surprises Act in all communications

**Get Help:**
‚Ä¢ State insurance commissioner
‚Ä¢ Hospital financial assistance office
‚Ä¢ Patient advocate organizations
‚Ä¢ Legal aid if needed

You should NOT have to pay out-of-network rates for emergency care - this is protected by federal law!`;
  }

  if (msg.includes('medically necessary')) {
    return `"Not medically necessary" is insurance-speak for "we don't want to pay" - here's how to fight it:

**What This Really Means:**
‚Ä¢ Insurance thinks there are cheaper alternatives
‚Ä¢ They believe the treatment is optional or cosmetic
‚Ä¢ Internal guidelines don't support coverage
‚Ä¢ Often a cost-saving denial, not medical judgment

**How to Prove Medical Necessity:**
1. **Get detailed doctor's letter** explaining why this specific treatment is needed
2. **Document failed alternatives** - Show you tried cheaper options first
3. **Provide medical records** - Demonstrate your condition's severity
4. **Get specialist support** - Referrals from specialists carry more weight

**Strong Medical Necessity Arguments:**
‚Ä¢ Treatment is the gold standard for your condition
‚Ä¢ Less expensive treatments have failed or aren't appropriate
‚Ä¢ Delaying treatment could worsen your condition
‚Ä¢ Treatment prevents more expensive complications
‚Ä¢ Your specific medical history requires this approach

**Appeal Strategy:**
1. **Use medical terminology** - Not emotional language
2. **Reference clinical guidelines** - Show treatment is standard of care
3. **Include supporting research** - Peer-reviewed studies
4. **Get peer-to-peer review** - Doctor talks directly to insurance medical director

**If Denied Again:**
‚Ä¢ Request external independent review
‚Ä¢ File complaint with state insurance commissioner
‚Ä¢ Consider legal assistance for expensive treatments

Remember: Insurance companies often deny first and approve on appeal - don't give up after the first "not medically necessary" denial!`;

‚Ä¢ Not on insurance formulary (approved drug list)
‚Ä¢ Requires prior authorization
‚Ä¢ Quantity limits exceeded
‚Ä¢ Step therapy required (try cheaper drugs first)
‚Ä¢ Generic available (must try generic first)

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Ask pharmacist** - They often know quick solutions
2. **Check formulary alternatives** - Similar drugs that are covered
3. **Contact doctor's office** - They may handle appeals automatically
4. **Request prior authorization** - Doctor submits medical justification

**Doctor's Appeal Letter Should Include:**
‚Ä¢ Why this specific medication is necessary
‚Ä¢ What other medications you've tried and failed
‚Ä¢ Side effects from alternative medications
‚Ä¢ Your specific medical condition requiring this drug
‚Ä¢ Consequences of not getting this medication

**Cost-Saving Alternatives While Appealing:**
‚Ä¢ Manufacturer patient assistance programs
‚Ä¢ GoodRx or similar discount programs
‚Ä¢ 30-day supply instead of 90-day while appealing
‚Ä¢ Samples from doctor's office
‚Ä¢ Pharmacy discount programs

**Appeal Timeline:**
‚Ä¢ Standard appeal: 30 days
‚Ä¢ Expedited appeal: 72 hours (if urgent)
‚Ä¢ External review if internal appeal fails

2. **Review your policy** - Confirm the service should be covered  
3. **Gather documentation** - Medical records, doctor's notes, policy documents
4. **File an appeal within deadlines** - Usually 60-180 days

**Appeal Success Tips:**
‚Ä¢ 60% of properly documented appeals succeed
‚Ä¢ Use medical terminology, not emotional language
‚Ä¢ Get your doctor to write a strong support letter
‚Ä¢ Reference specific policy language
‚Ä¢ Keep copies and send via certified mail

**Next Steps:**
- Internal appeal first (required)
- External review if internal fails (often binding in your favor)

**Documents You Need for Appeals:**
‚Ä¢ Original denial letter with reason codes
‚Ä¢ Complete medical records related to treatment
‚Ä¢ Doctor's letter of medical necessity
‚Ä¢ Your insurance policy or benefits summary
‚Ä¢ Any supporting medical research or guidelines
‚Ä¢ Records of previous treatments tried

**Appeal Letter Should Include:**
‚Ä¢ Patient information and claim number
